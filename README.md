# Odinbook (Fakebook)

This app is the final project of the Node.js module in the Odin Project curriculum. It has the basic functionalities of Facebook and is built for educational purposes only.

The code includes Passport authentication with the Facebook strategy but it is currently not implemented due to Facebook's requirement to include Terms and Conditions as well as Privacy Policy on a page to allow logging in with Facebook credentials.
The database is populated with accounts created with my seeds.js file using the [Faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker) module.
I use mongoDB as a database with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) object modeling. For my image database I use [Cloudinary](cloudinary.com).

The live version of the app is deployed on Heroku and is available **[here](https://odinbook-kikupiku.herokuapp.com/)**.
